#Marija's Project Portfolio
###(derived from Udacity's Project 2 of Full Stack Nanodegree program)

This website is a modification of Udacity's Project 2 for the Full Stack Programming Nanodegree.
The website displays a selection of Marija's web application projects. Clicking the individual project images brings up a modal window showing a detailed description of the project and relevant links. Future expansions will include other/additional projects and links to project screenshots and/or videos.

The website utilizes bootstrap for the framework of the site.

##Folders & Files
* index.html
* config.json
* css/bootstrap.css
* css/style.css
* css/bootstrap.min.css
* images (folder)
* js/bootstrap.js
* js/bootstrap.min.js

**index.html** contains the html code.

**config.json** contains elements related to the use of bootstrap.

**css/bootstrap.css** contains the framework style code. This file is not directly referenced by the website. It is the full version of bootstrip.min.css for development use and has not been modified. Final version of website will not include this file.

**css/bootstrap.min.css** contains the minified version of bootstrap.css and is not modified from it's original version. Any style changes are in the style.css file.

**css/style.css** contains the modifications and additions to the style code.

**images** folder contains the images required for the site.

**js/bootstrap.js** contains the javascript required to run the javascript features on the site. It is unmodified from it's original version. It is for development and is not referenced by the website. Final version of the website will not include this file.

**js/bootstrap.min.js** contains the minified version of bootstrap.js and is not modified from it's original version.

##Using the Site
**To run the site**, place all files in the same folder, open index.html in a web browser.

**To customize the files**, you can open the index.html file in your favorite text editor and make changes as desired. You can review the references to bootstrap using the bootstrap.css file, but good practice is to make modifications/additions in a separate css file (in this case, you can change the style.css file). Save the files and refresh index.html to see your new web page.

Mockup/basic design ideas for this application were provided by [Udacity](http://www.Udacity.com). Additional instruction on Front End Development is available by signing up for a class on their site. Bootstrap provides the framework. Additional enhancements by Marija Robinson.
